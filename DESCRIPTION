Description: This package integrates the decomposition of time series into
    trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting and
    characterizing abrupt changes within the trend and seasonal components. BFAST
    can be used to analyze different types of satellite image time series and can
    be applied to other disciplines dealing with seasonal or non-seasonal time
    series, such as hydrology, climatology, and econometrics. The algorithm can be
    extended to label detected changes with information on the parameters of the
    fitted piecewise linear models. BFAST monitoring functionality is added based on
    a paper that has been submitted to Remote Sensing of Environment. BFAST monitor
    provides functionality to detect disturbance in near real-time based on BFAST-
    type models. BFAST approach is flexible approach that handles missing data
    without interpolation. Furthermore now different models can be used to fit the
    time series data and detect structural changes (breaks).
