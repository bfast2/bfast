\title{Create a regular time series object by combining data and date information}
\usage{
bfastts(data, dates, type = c("irregular", "16-day", "10-day"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data vector or matrix where columns represent variables}

\item{dates}{Optional input of dates for each measurement in the 'data'
variable. In case the data is a irregular time series, a vector with 'dates'
for each measurement can be supplied using this 'dates' variable. The
irregular data will be linked with the dates vector to create daily regular
time series with a frequency = 365. Extra days in leap years might cause
problems. Please be careful using this option as it is experimental.
Feedback is welcome.}

\item{type}{(\code{"irregular"}) indicates that the data is collected at
irregular dates and as such will be converted to a daily time series.
(\code{"16-day"}) indicates that data is collected at a regular time interval
(every 16-days e.g. like the MODIS 16-day data products). (\code{"10-day"})
indicates that data is collected at a 10-day time interval of the SPOT VEGETATION
(S10) product. Warning: Only use this function for the SPOT VEGETATION S10 time series,
as for other 10-day time series a different approach might be required.}
}
\value{
\code{bfastts} returns an object of class \code{"ts"}, i.e., a list
with components as follows.  \item{zz}{ a regular \code{"ts"} time series
with a frequency equal to 365 or 23 i.e. 16-day time series.}
}
\description{
Create a regular time series object by combining measurements (data) and
time (dates) information.

\details{
\code{bfastts} create a regular time series

\examples{
# 16-day time series (i.e. MODIS)
timedf <- data.frame(y = som$NDVI.b, dates = dates[1:nrow(som)])
bfastts(timedf$y, timedf$dates, type = "16-day")

# Irregular
head(bfastts(timedf$y, timedf$dates, type = "irregular"), 50)

# Example of use with a raster
f <- system.file("extdata/modisraster.tif", package="bfast")
modisbrick <- terra::rast(f)
ndvi <- bfastts(unlist(modisbrick[1]), dates, type = c("16-day")) ## data of pixel 1
plot(ndvi/10000) 

# Time series of 4 pixels
modis_ts = t(modisbrick[1:4])
# Data with multiple columns, 2-4 are external regressors
ndvi <- bfastts(modis_ts, dates, type = c("16-day"))
plot(ndvi/10000)
