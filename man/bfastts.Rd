\title{Create a regular time series object by combining data and date information}
\usage{
bfastts(data, dates, type = c("irregular", "16-day", "10-day"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data vector}

\item{dates}{Optional input of dates for each measurement in the 'data'
variable. In case the data is a irregular time series, a vector with 'dates'
for each measurement can be supplied using this 'dates' variable. The
irregular data will be linked with the dates vector to create daily regular
time series with a frequency = 365. Extra days in leap years might cause
problems. Please be carefull using this option as it is experimental.
Feedback is welcome.}

\item{type}{(\code{"irregular"}) indicates that the data is collected at
irregular dates and as such will be converted to a daily time series.
(\code{"16-day"})indicates that data is collected at a regular time interval
(every 16-days e.g. like the MODIS 16-day data products)}
}
\value{
\code{bfastts} returns an object of class \code{"ts"}, i.e., a list
with components as follows.  \item{zz}{ a regular \code{"ts"} time series
with a frequency equal to 365 or 23 i.e. 16-day time series.}
}
\description{

time (dates) information.

\examples{
library("raster")
f <- system.file("extdata/modisraster.grd", package="bfast")
modisbrick <- brick(f)
ndvi <- bfastts(as.vector(modisbrick[1]), dates, type = c("16-day")) ## data of pixel 1
plot(ndvi/10000)
