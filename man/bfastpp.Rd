\title{Time Series Preprocessing for BFAST-Type Models}
\usage{
bfastpp(data, order = 3, lag = NULL, slag = NULL, na.action = na.omit,
  stl = c("none", "trend", "seasonal", "both"), formula = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A time series of class \code{\link[stats]{ts}}, or another
object that can be coerced to such. For seasonal components, a frequency
greater than 1 is required.}

\item{order}{numeric. Order of the harmonic term, defaulting to \code{3}.}

\item{lag}{numeric. Orders of the autoregressive term, by default omitted.}

\item{slag}{numeric. Orders of the seasonal autoregressive term, by default
omitted.}

\item{na.action}{function for handling \code{NA}s in the data (after all
other preprocessing).}

\item{stl}{character. Prior to all other preprocessing, STL (season-trend
decomposition via LOESS smoothing) can be employed for trend-adjustment
and/or season-adjustment.  The \code{"trend"} or \code{"seasonal"} component
or both from \code{\link[stats]{stl}} are removed from each column in
\code{data}. By default (\code{"none"}), no STL adjustment is used.}

\item{formula}{regression model to be used (see
\code{\link[bfast]{bfastmonitor}}).  If given, only independent variables
that occur in the formula will be computed and the output will be a list of
the design matrix, the response vector, and the vector of times instead of a
single \code{data.frame}. Providing a formula may reduce relative expensive
calls of \code{model.matrix} and \code{model.frame} in following operations.}
}
\value{
If no formula is provided, \code{bfastpp} returns a
\code{"data.frame"} with the following variables (some of which may be
matrices).  \item{time}{numeric vector of time stamps,}
\item{response}{response vector (first column of \code{data}),}
\item{trend}{linear time trend (running from 1 to number of observations),}
\item{season}{factor indicating season period,} \item{harmon}{harmonic
seasonal terms (of specified \code{order}),} \item{lag}{autoregressive terms
(or orders \code{lag}, if any),} \item{slag}{seasonal autoregressive terms
(or orders \code{slag}, if any),} \item{xreg}{covariate regressor (all
columns of \code{data} except the first, if any).}

If a formula is given,\code{bfastpp} returns a \code{list} with components
\code{X}, \code{y}, and \code{t}, where \code{X} is the design matrix of the
model, \code{y} is the response vector, and \code{t} represents the time of
observations. \code{X} will only contain variables that occur in the
formula. Columns of \code{X} have names as decribed above.
}
\description{
Time series preprocessing for subsequent regression modeling.  Based on a
(seasonal) time series, a data frame with the response, seasonal terms, a
trend term, (seasonal) autoregressive terms, and covariates is computed.
This can subsequently be employed in regression models.
}
\details{
To facilitate (linear) regression models of time series data, \code{bfastpp}
facilitates preprocessing and setting up regressor terms. It returns a
\code{data.frame} containing the first column of the \code{data} as the
\code{response} while further columns (if any) are used as covariates
\code{xreg}. Additionally, a linear trend, seasonal dummies, harmonic
seasonal terms, and (seasonal) autoregressive terms are provided.

Optionally, each column of \code{data} can be seasonally adjusted and/or
trend-adjusted via STL (season-trend decomposition via LOESS smoothing)
prior to preprocessing. The idea would be to capture season and/or trend
nonparametrically prior to regression modelling.

\examples{

## set up time series
library(zoo)
ndvi <- as.ts(zoo(cbind(a = som$NDVI.a, b = som$NDVI.b), som$Time))
ndvi <- window(ndvi, start = c(2006, 1), end = c(2009, 23))

## parametric season-trend model
d1 <- bfastpp(ndvi, order = 2)
d1lm <- lm(response ~ trend + harmon, data = d1)
summary(d1lm)

## autoregressive model (after nonparametric season-trend adjustment)
d2 <- bfastpp(ndvi, stl = "both", lag = 1:2)
d2lm <- lm(response ~ lag, data = d2)
summary(d2lm)

## provide a formula and use the lower level lm.fit function
d3 <- bfastpp(ndvi, stl = "both", lag = 1:2, formula = response ~ lag)
d3lm <- lm.fit(d3$X, d3$y)
d3lm$coefficients
